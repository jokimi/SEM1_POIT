          <molang>ABOUT MOLANG</molang>
          <info>Born out of the encounter of two women with very different universes, Molang and Piu Piu started life in 2010 as doodles by Hye Ji Yoon, a young and talented Korean illustrator. French author and director Marie-Caroline Villand felt in love with the two adorable characters, and started to develop their personalities, values, universe and stories. The TV series that she created is now a worldwide hit, with over 300 episodes broadcasted in 194 countries. Molang is also a viral sensation, with over 20 Billion views on GIPHY and 6 million social media followers, and a lifestyle brand with a successful consumer products program, supported by our molang.com e-shop and 15 international licensing and merchandising agents.</info>
